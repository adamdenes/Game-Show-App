## “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game
The game will randomly select a phrase from a pool of phrases.
Each time a player guesses a letter, the app will compare the chosen letter
with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the board will be updated
with the chosen letters.

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. 
If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, one of the player’s 5 guesses will be removed.
